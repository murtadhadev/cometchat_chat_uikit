The <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/cometchat_uikit_shared"><strong>CometChat UIKit Shared</strong></a> serves as a foundation for two robust UI Kits - <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/cometchat_chat_uikit"><strong>CometChat Chat UIKit</strong></a> and <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/cometchat_calls_uikit"><strong>CometChat Calls UIKit</strong></a>. The modular design of the resources and widgets provided by this package ensures efficient code reuse and consistent styling across your app.  <br/>

- Dart >=3.0.5
- Android Studio 2022.2

## Getting Started

To set up CometChat's Flutter UIKit and utilize CometChat for your chat and calls functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.
- After registering, log into your CometChat account and create a new app. Once created, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Keep these credentials secure as you'll need them later.
- Check the [key concepts](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/v4/flutter-uikit/key-concepts) to understand the basic components of CometChat.
- Refer to the [Integration Steps](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/v4/flutter-uikit/integration#getting-started) Steps in our documentation to integrate into your Flutter app.
